Allows the connection of 1.8 clients to 1.9

This plugin modifies netty to allow connection of 1.9 clients to 1.8,

As of this point it is not finished, I need to fix:

Entity Movement Sync

Teleporting (perhaps)

Attempt to make boats nicer when they don't work

Verify slot IDs to prevent dual wielding :)

Use reflection more.



This took hours of work, so if you enjoy this consider looking into contacting me and supporting my projects.
