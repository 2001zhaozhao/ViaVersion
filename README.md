# ViaVersion API Dev


This is an experimental branch, but soon to be live.


The things which stop this from going live:

Need to implement debug mode using deprecated PacketType for english

and then javadocs.


It would be nice to have a Pipeline cache so it doesn't have to figure it out all the time.
(and to ensure it uses the shortest pipeline)
