# ViaVersion API Dev


This is an experimental branch, but soon to be live.


The things which stop this from going live:

Need to implement debug mode using deprecated PacketType for english

Need to implement a way for mappers to register listeners <--


and eventually we'll add a way to add things the way chunk handler works!!

and then javadocs.

and maybe check for memory leaks.


It would be nice to have a Pipeline cache so it doesn't have to figure it out all the time.
(and to ensure it uses the shortest pipeline)
